##### Homework Assignment 4: Challenge - jQuery

Challenging Option of the Unit4/jQuery Homework - Star Wars RPG.  This is a fun and interactive 'RPG' that runs in your web browser, made using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.  The original instructions for the game involved something similar in name; however, I was displeased with the visuals, and being a big fan of the original Star Wars Extended Universe, I decided to liven things up a bit and include better, albeit little known, characters.  (The Recommended Homework (Crystal Collector) can be found on my [Portfolio](https://sasquatchxyz.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/)).

## Getting Started

* [Star Wars RPG](https://sasquatchxyz.github.io/RPG-Unit-4-Game/) - Deployed Version of the Site can be viewed here.

### Prerequisites

The only thing you need to enjoy the fun of the game is a web browser.

```
Web Browser - Google Chrome Preferred
```

### Installing

No installation necessary.

### Notes on Gameplay

* Each character in the game has 3 attributes, with values unique to their character: 'Health Points', 'Attack Power', and 'Counter Attack Power'.
* Each time the player attacks, their particular character's 'Attack Power' is increased by it's base 'Attack Power'; however, the enemy character only has their 'Counter Attack Power', which never changes.
* There is no healing or recovery of 'Health Points'.
* Ultimately it comes down to picking the right opponent's to face so that you can grind your 'Attack Power', rather than choosing the character with the most 'Health Points'.
