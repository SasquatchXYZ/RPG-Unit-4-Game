# RPG-Unit-4-Game

Challenging Option of the Unit4/jQuery Homework - Star Wars RPG.  A fun and interactive game for web browsers.

## Getting Started

This is a fun and interactive 'RPG' that runs in your web browser.  The original instructions for the game involved something similar in name; however, I was displeased with the visuals, and being a big fan of the original Star Wars Extended Universe, I decided to liven things up a bit and include better, albeit little known, characters.

### Prerequisites

The only thing you need to enjoy the fun of the game is a web browser.

```
Web Browser - Google Chrome Preferred
```

### Installing

No installation necessary.
